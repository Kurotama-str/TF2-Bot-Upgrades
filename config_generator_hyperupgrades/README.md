New way to handle most hyperupgrades config. Weapons will stay generated for now. You can either grab attributes from TF2 and tf_econ_data or use the provided file with aliases already written. \
Use the python script to generate a config file for hu_upgrades (individual upgrades) and hu_attributes (upgrade attribution per class/slot/weapon).
- In bash : python3 cfggen-hypupgr.py attributes attributes.csv ; python3 cfggen-hypupgr.py upgrades upgrades.csv
